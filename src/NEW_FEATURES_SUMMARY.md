# New Features Summary

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Student Notifications for New Classes** 🔔

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Notification Structure
{
  id: "class_${timestamp}",
  title: "New Physics Class Available!",
  type: "notice",
  subject: "Physics",
  targetGrade: "10",
  content: "Teacher Name has created a new class...",
  createdAt: "2025-10-28T...",
  teacherName: "Teacher Name",
  isClassNotification: true,
  classId: 12345
}
```

    const updated = classes.filter(c => c.id !== classId);
    setClasses(updated);
    localStorage.setItem("teacherClasses", JSON.stringify(updated));
    
    // TODO: API call when backend connected
